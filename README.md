    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

## Installation

To use as a general utility, install the CLI package globally

```bash
npm install -g @stdlib/assert-is-absolute-uri-cli
```

<!-- CLI usage documentation. -->

## Usage

```text
Usage: is-absolute-uri [options] [<uri>]

Options:

  -h,    --help                Print this message.
  -V,    --version             Print the package version.
         --split sep           Delimiter for stdin data. Default: '/\\r?\\n/'.

<!-- CLI usage examples. -->

<section class="examples">

## Examples

```bash
$ is-absolute-uri https://google.com
true
```

To use as a [standard stream][standard-streams],

```bash
$ echo -n 'https://google.com' | is-absolute-uri
true
```

By default, when used as a [standard stream][standard-streams], the implementation assumes newline-delimited data. To specify an alternative delimiter, set the `split` option.

```bash
$ echo -n 'https://google.com\tbeep' | is-absolute-uri --split '\t'
true
false
```
